# Brain Tumor Detection App - TODO

## Phase 1: Core UI Implementation
- [x] Create onboarding screen with welcome and feature overview
- [x] Design and implement home screen (Analyze tab) with upload button
- [x] Create image picker integration (camera and gallery)
- [x] Build image preview screen with zoom capability
- [x] Implement results screen with tumor/no tumor display
- [x] Create history screen (History tab) with analysis list
- [x] Build settings screen (Settings tab) with app configuration
- [x] Set up bottom tab navigation (Analyze, History, Settings)

## Phase 2: Image Processing & Upload
- [x] Implement image compression and optimization
- [x] Add image metadata extraction (size, format, dimensions)
- [x] Create loading state and progress indicators
- [x] Implement error handling for invalid images
- [x] Add image validation (format, size, dimensions)

## Phase 3: ML Model Integration
- [x] Implement model inference simulation (placeholder for actual model)
- [x] Create confidence score calculation
- [ ] Download and prepare pre-trained model (MobileNetV2 or EfficientNet)
- [ ] Set up actual model inference pipeline
- [ ] Implement data augmentation for different MRI angles
- [ ] Add model quantization for mobile deployment
- [ ] Test model accuracy and performance

## Phase 4: Results & Visualization
- [x] Display tumor detection results with color coding
- [x] Show confidence percentage and visual gauge
- [x] Implement result save functionality
- [x] Create result sharing feature
- [x] Add timestamp and metadata to results
- [ ] Generate saliency map/heatmap for visualization

## Phase 5: Data Management
- [x] Implement local storage for analysis history (AsyncStorage)
- [x] Add result deletion functionality
- [x] Ensure privacy-first approach (no cloud storage of medical images)
- [ ] Create database schema for storing results
- [ ] Implement history filtering and search
- [ ] Add export analysis history feature

## Phase 6: Settings & Configuration
- [x] Implement theme toggle (light/dark mode)
- [x] Create about/info screen
- [x] Add model information display
- [x] Implement feedback/contact feature
- [x] Add medical disclaimer
- [ ] Add notification preferences

## Phase 7: Testing & Optimization
- [ ] Unit tests for model inference
- [ ] Integration tests for image upload flow
- [ ] Performance optimization for inference
- [ ] Test on iOS and Android devices
- [ ] Validate accessibility features
- [ ] Test with various MRI image formats

## Phase 8: Deployment Preparation
- [x] Create app icon and branding assets
- [x] Update app configuration with branding
- [ ] Generate splash screen
- [ ] Prepare app store descriptions
- [ ] Create privacy policy
- [ ] Set up error tracking and analytics
